        "content": "Schumy Vanna Kaviyangal is run by a group of anonymous individuals who come out publicly only with creepy guy Fawkes masks. We are known for our unapologetic and undemanding straightforward approach in spreading Dravidian ideology. Our key goal is to enlighten young adults and the common crowd with the right political knowledge. We are also known for our movie discussions because all our key team members have ample experience in films and its industry for years. We have conducted various film based research over the years and expressed them over our podcast. We plan to continue entertaining the crowd with our political and social commentary while we educate them at the same time through history, economics ,science & socio politics by using humour as an appetizer."

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
